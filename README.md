A digital journal/diary application built with C++ and Qt for the OOP class.Besides the required functionalities ,I also implemented an AI chatbot via API that can analyse your journal entries and chat to you based on them.The AI keeps hold of the 20 most recent entries in your journals in order to avoid overloading the API calls.
