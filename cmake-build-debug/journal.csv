A Walk in the Park|Today, I decided to take a stroll in the nearby park. The weather was warm, and the sun cast a gentle glow over everything. As I walked, I noticed the scent of fresh grass and blooming flowers. I sat on a bench under a tall oak tree and watched kids play frisbee while an older couple fed the ducks by the pond. It felt peaceful, and for a moment, I forgot about all my worries.|15:42:28 / 25.05.2025
